# What is EquationTracer?
EquationTracer uses NumPy and Pygame to convert an arbitrary scribble into a parametric equation which you can plot on Graphing Calculators such as Desmos!

## Installation
This is a guide on how to install EquationTracer.
>**Note**: You need Python installed on your system, along with either pip or pipx.

If you do not want to use pip or pipx, you can also alternatively clone this git repository.

Linux: `pip install equationtracer`

Mac: `pip3 install equationtracer`

Windows: `pipx install equationtracer`

## Running
To run the program, type into a command line: `trace-equation`

If you installed the program with pip (instead of pipx) on windows, or if the above command doesn't work, you can also do:

Windows: `py -m equationtracer`

Others: `python3 -m equationtracer`
